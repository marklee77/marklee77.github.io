<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/20150715_143559.jpg" alt="Alexander Wolf, HARNESS SC Bootcamp Keynote" /></p>

<p>In July 2015, the HARNESS project hosted a Software Carpentry bootcamp/workshop
at the SAP headquarters in Feltham, near London Heathrow. This was an outreach
activity with three distinct, but related, objectives: 1) to disseminate
HARNESS project outcomes to the research community, 2) to bring together
researchers interested in topics relevant to HARNESS, and 3) provide skills and
knowledge training as a public service to contribute toward the improvement
computational science practice within the European Union. This activity was
particularly targeted at the &ldquo;HPC&rdquo;, &ldquo;cloud research&rdquo;, and &ldquo;heterogeneous
compute research&rdquo; communities discussed in the HARNESS deliverable
documentation. In addition to the standard topics on task automation, version
control, and programming in python, there were additional modules on cloud
computing, FPGA data-flow engines, and distributed file systems.
Representatives from both the Software Sustainability Institute and the
European Grid Infrastructure attended to provide additional teaching support.
The full list of topics covered was as follows:</p>

</ul>

<p>The first three modules; <em>Automating Tasks with the Unix Shell</em>, <em>Version
Control with Git</em>, and <em>Building Programs with Python</em>; were drawn from the
standard Software Carpentry curriculum. These modules cover essential core
skills for computational science and so contributed directy to the third
objective of providing skills and knowledge training as described above, and
the inclusion of these modules is required for a workshop to be branded as
a Software Carpentry bootcamp. The Software Carpentry organization publishes
lessons and guidance on workshop hosting, and has an established reputation for
quality, and so we believe that the inclusion of these materials was strategic
for driving outside interest in this activity. As an additional consideration,
covering these materials made it possible to target a wider pool of users than
would have been possible otherwise, and to ensure that they would possess the
essential skills to follow the more advanced HARNESS-specific lessons.</p>

<p>Three of the remaining four modules were developed specially for this course to
showcase HARNESS-related technologies. In <em>Managing Cloud Services with
ConPaaS</em>, Guillaume Pierre from UR1 lead the attendees through using the
<a href="http://conpaas.eu">ConPaaS</a> web service interface to deploy a WordPress blog.
In <em>Dataflow Programming with Maxeler</em>, Peter Sanders from Maxeler discussed
how FPGA data flow engines achieve computational speedup over conventional CPUs
despite their lower Mhz ratings by allowing users to create deep processing
pipelines, and showed attendees how to develop custom FPGA configurations using
the Maxeler IDE. Attendees were even given access to a virtual machine running
a DFE similar so they could follow along with the programming exercises on
their own laptops. In <em>Distributed Filesystems with XtreemFS</em>, Christoph
Kleinweber from ZIB explained the differences between networked and distributed
filesystems and showed attendees how to build a storage solution using
<a href="http://xtreemfs.org">XtreemFS</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, in <em>EGI Federated Cloud for Open Science</em> Diego Scardaci and Gergely
Sipos from EGI, a separate project with collaborative ties to HARNESS,
demonstrated how attendees could access the EGI federated cloud, a multi-site
research oriented and publicly funded cloud targeted at computational
researchers in the European Union.</p>

<p>There was also a keynote on the topic of Heterogeneous Accelerators in the
Cloud given by Professor Alexander Wolf (HARNESS, ICL), and a demonstration of
the HARNESS cloud platform given by Gabriel Coutinho (HARNESS, ICL).</p>

<h2>Response</h2>

<p>This was a popular and well attended event. It was advertised primarily through
the web and social media, including facebook, twitter, LinkedIn, and various
targeted email lists. By the start of the event, 42 people had signed up and
there was growing waiting list. Of these, 25 attended, which was a slightly
higher drop-off than expected, possibly due to difficulties in reaching the
location via public transport.</p>

<p>The informal feedback offered during the workshop was almost uniformly
positive. Overall, the learners seemed happy with the content and breadth of
topics covered. A number of attendees expressed that they were very happy to
have the opportunity to take a higher-level survey of recent developments and
cutting-edge technologies, even when there might not be immediate applications
for their particular research area. The attendees were particularly
enthusiastic about the keynote, and even though teaching ran late on the last
day, a solid majority remained to watch the demonstration of the HARNESS
technology preview.</p>

<h2>Survey Results</h2>

<p>Those who signed up for the event were asked to complete pre-event surveys,
while those who actually attended were asked to complete post-event surveys as
well. The purpose of the pre-event surveys was to assess information about the
background and relative level of knowledge of those who would be attending in
order to properly target the lessons. The purpose of the post-event surveys was
to determine level of satisfaction and take on feedback that to improve the
lessons and future events.</p>

<p>Of the 42 people who signed up, 25 submitted responses to the pre-event survey,
which was a higher response rate than expected. Interestingly, 4 people who
attended the event did not respond to the survey, and similarly, 4 people who
responded to the survey did not attend the event. Most of the survey
respondents were researchers associated with universities in England, though
one was from Belfast and another from Italy, and three others remain of
indeterminate origin. There were 8 responses from females and 17 from males,
and, with only a few exceptions, those who responded appeared to be at
a relatively early career stage. For more details about the career stage and
background of the respondents, please refer to the following figures:</p>

<p><img src="/images/harness_sc_career_stage.svg" alt="Survey Responses: Career Stage" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/harness_sc_discipline.svg" alt="Survey Responses: Discipline" /></p>

<p>Of the 25 people who attended the workshop, 10 responded to the post-event
survey, and all of these had previously responded to the pre-event survey.
There was some variation in the satisfaction with individual lessons, but none
stood out as being particularly unsatisfying to the attendees. The overall level
of reported satisfaction was good, with 7 out of 10 responses indicating that
the attendee was &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; or &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; with the event, and only one
person reporting that they were &ldquo;unsatisfied&rdquo;. Similarly, 8 out of 10 attendees
reported that they were &ldquo;likely&rdquo; or &ldquo;very likely&rdquo; to recommend similar events
to colleagues in the future, while only one person reported that they were
&ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; to recommend this or similar events.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Overall, we were happy with the number of attendees and we believe that the
interest and level of engagement displayed were much higher than if we had
simply presented HARNESS in a more typical venue, such as a workshop or trade
show. The drop-off from 42 (our maximum capacity) signed up, to 25 attending
was disappointing, and likely had to do with difficulty in reaching the
location, so we will take this problem into account when planning similar
events in the future. There were no major technical glitches that ruined an
entire lesson, but there were some delays caused by improperly configured
software, and one of the cloud services did not respond well to the load it was
given, thus demonstrating the need to allocate sufficient time for debugging
and thoroughly test everything in advance.</p>
