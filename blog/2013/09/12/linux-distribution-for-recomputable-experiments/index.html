<div class="entry-content"><p>I had a great time yesterday at the
<a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/workshop-research-software-engineers">Workshop for Research Software Engineers</a>
put on by the
<a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">Sustainable Software Institute</a> and
hosted at the <a href="http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford e-Research Centre</a>.
While there, I had an interesting conversation with
<a href="http://ipg.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/">Ian Gent</a>, writer of
&ldquo;<a href="http://recomputation.org/">The Recomputation Manifesto</a>&rdquo;. You
should head over to the site and read some of Ian&rsquo;s articles, particularly
<a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-07-09-recomputation-manifesto">this one</a>,
as he&rsquo;s put quite a lot of thought into the topic. The gist of the
idea is as follows (apologies Ian for any misunderstandings, you should really
go to his site after this one): 1) computational experiments are only valuable
if they can be verified and validated, 2) in theory, it should be fairly easy
to make computational science experiments, particularly small-scale computer
science experiments, perfectly repeatable for all time, 3) in practice this is
never/rarely done and reproduction/verification is really hard, 4) the best or
possibly only way to accomplish this goal is to make sure that the entire
environment is reproducible by packaging it in a virtual machine.</p>

<p>I have a few thoughts of my own on how we can better accomplish these goals
after the break. The implementation of these ideas should be fairly simple and
basically add up to extending or developing a few system utilities and
systematically archiving distributions and updates on a service like
<a href="http://figshare.com">figshare</a>, but I believe that the benefits to
the cause of improving the reproducibility of computational experiments would be
enormous.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Ian has spent some time working with <a
href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>, a user friendly front end to
<a href="http://virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> (and now some other hypervisors)
that allows users to create custom virtual machines from a few standard base VM
images. Vagrant has some really nice features, like tracking all of the
configuration information in a text file that can be managed through a version
control system like <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a>,
<a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com">bzr</a> or
<a href="http://darcs.net/">darcs</a>. Vagrant also plays nicely with some of
the more popular devops configuration management systems (including
<a href="http://puppetlabs.com">puppet</a>,
<a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">chef</a>, and
<a href="http://ansibleworks.com">ansible</a>), automatically configures file
synchronization between the working directory on the host an VM, and sets up
private networking between the host and one or more virtual machines in
a collection, so it&rsquo;s easy to ssh in and make network connections between
related machines.</p>

<p>I think that Vagrant is a great step forward in making it easier for
researchers to work with virtual machines and integrate them into their
workflows, but there are a few more things that need to be done. For one thing,
Vagrant is strongly dependent on the VirtualBox &ldquo;Guest Additons&rdquo; to
interact with the hypervisor from the VM. There is some support for different
providers now, but Vagrant treats each of these as a special case. Really,
there needs to be some standardization of this interface, so that the same VM
image can be reliably instantiated on any hypervisor and work with tools like
Vagrant transparently.</p>

<p>Another problem is that just virtualizing your experiment doesn&rsquo;t necessarily
make it easier to understand your methodology. You can create a VM blob and
archive that, even upload it to figshare or a similar service, register it with
<a href="http://datacite.org">DataCite</a> and give it a
<a href="http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a>, and that would at least solve the problem
of re-running the same experiment (for reasonably tractable experiments
anyway), but it would still be hard for others to know exactly what was done to
prepare the environment (you could have been hacking binaries with a hex editor
for all we know). It also suffers from the problem that it requires researchers
to pass around lots of mutli-gigabyte blobs that contain mostly-redundant data.
A much better plan is to start from a standard base image and then script in
all of the configuration and build steps (possibly within your Vagrantfile).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, current operating system distributions haven&rsquo;t been designed
with the idea of making it easy for researchers to create and archive
experiment environments in mind. For example, starting from the precise32.box
base box, it&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable to want to install some additional system
software (particularly build tools if you need them to compile source code),
but &ldquo;apt-get update&rdquo; will always get the latest software packages, and using
updated software could cause your experiment to build or run differently than
it did before. Neither <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a> nor
<a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> guarantee that every version of every
software package will always be available, making it necessary to keep your own
versions in a repository, which adds to complexity and overheads.</p>

<p>My idea is to archive full repository images at certain points in time so that
they have a DOI (or some other permanently reference-able
<a href="http://handle.net">handle</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink">permalink</a> if DOIs seem
inappropriate). Weekly or monthly updates could also be generated and given
their own DOI. These updates would not need to be full mirrors of the
repository, but could just contain primarily software packages that had been
changed since the last update. The updated software catalog could refer to
previous update DOIs or the base repository DOI for packages that hadn&rsquo;t
changed. In the end, the implementation of this idea would entail some changes
to the procedures for archiving software, and some extensions to apt-get (or
yum or yast) to work with DOIs instead of URLs. The payoff would be that users
of tools like Vagrant would be able to specify a specific version of an
operating system at a specific moment in time, forever, by simply giving the
correct DOI in their configuration (Vagrantfile or similar). It could be done
by interested parties (e.g., academics) independent of the distribution
providers, but there are questions about who would pay for storage and access,
and keeping everything reasonably up-to-date, so perhaps it makes the most
sense to approach the providers and get support there. It really wouldn&rsquo;t add
very much complexity to their existing processes.</p>

<p>One other idea I have is to extend tools like vagrant to better support
a paradigm of &ldquo;builder VMs&rdquo; and &ldquo;worker appliances&rdquo;. Basically, setting up an
experiment might require various specific versions of different tools,
particularly compilers, linkers, etcetera, that take up quite a lot of space.
These tools need to be downloaded from a specific version of a repository and
instantiated within a VM in order to replicate the required build environment,
but aren&rsquo;t needed to actually run the experiment. Instead of downloading
everything needed for a fully-interactive operating system complete with
build-tools onto the experiment-running VM, and then possibly distributing this
multi-gigabyte image to a cloud back-end, it makes a lot more sense to install
the build tools on a local-machine VM, and use this local VM to create
a minimal virtual appliance to actually run the experiment. Ideally, this
appliance should have only the code and data needed to run the experiment, and
could even be stripped of things like the standard shell utilities and login
tools. This would minimize both the size and complexity of the resulting VM
used to run experiments.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to move forward on implementing some of these ideas over the
next few months, but I have classes to teach and papers to write, so it might
take a little while. If anyone wants to help out, or has some suggestions for
a better approach, then please email me or drop a comment below.</p>
