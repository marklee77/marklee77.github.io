  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/20150715_143559.jpg" alt="Alexander Wolf, HARNESS SC Bootcamp Keynote" /></p>

<p>In July 2015, the HARNESS project hosted a Software Carpentry bootcamp/workshop
at the SAP headquarters in Feltham, near London Heathrow. This was an outreach
activity with three distinct, but related, objectives: 1) to disseminate
HARNESS project outcomes to the research community, 2) to bring together
researchers interested in topics relevant to HARNESS, and 3) provide skills and
knowledge training as a public service to contribute toward the improvement
computational science practice within the European Union. This activity was
particularly targeted at the &ldquo;HPC&rdquo;, &ldquo;cloud research&rdquo;, and &ldquo;heterogeneous
compute research&rdquo; communities discussed in the HARNESS deliverable
documentation. In addition to the standard topics on task automation, version
control, and programming in python, there were additional modules on cloud
computing, FPGA data-flow engines, and distributed file systems.
Representatives from both the Software Sustainability Institute and the
European Grid Infrastructure attended to provide additional teaching support.
The full list of topics covered was as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">Automating Tasks with the Unix Shell</a>
(Alistair Grant, SSI)</li>
<li><a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">Version Control with Git</a>
(Alistair Grant, SSI)</li>
<li><a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/">Building Programs with Python</a>
(Mark Stillwell, HARNESS, ICL)</li>
<li><a href="https://harnesscloud.github.io/2015-07-15-feltham/conpaas/slides.pdf">Managing Cloud Services with ConPaaS</a>
(Guillaume Pierre, HARNESS, UR1)</li>
<li><a href="https://harnesscloud.github.io/2015-07-15-feltham/maxeler/CodeCarpentry-MaxelerDataflow1.pdf">Dataflow Programming with Maxeler</a>
(Peter Sanders, HARNESS, Maxeler)</li>
<li><a href="https://documents.egi.eu/document/2551">EGI Federated Cloud for Open Science</a>
(Diego Scardaci and Gergely Sipos, EGI)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/harnesscloud/2015-07-15-feltham-students/blob/master/xtreemfs/slides.pdf">Distributed Filesystems with XtreemFS</a>
(Christoph Kleinweber, HARNESS, ZIB)</li>
</ul>


<p>The first three modules; <em>Automating Tasks with the Unix Shell</em>, <em>Version
Control with Git</em>, and <em>Building Programs with Python</em>; were drawn from the
standard Software Carpentry curriculum. These modules cover essential core
skills for computational science and so contributed directy to the third
objective of providing skills and knowledge training as described above, and
the inclusion of these modules is required for a workshop to be branded as
a Software Carpentry bootcamp. The Software Carpentry organization publishes
lessons and guidance on workshop hosting, and has an established reputation for
quality, and so we believe that the inclusion of these materials was strategic
for driving outside interest in this activity. As an additional consideration,
covering these materials made it possible to target a wider pool of users than
would have been possible otherwise, and to ensure that they would posess the
essential skills to follow the more advanced HARNESS-specific lessons.</p>

<p>Three of the remaining four modules were developed specially for this course to
showcase HARNESS-related technologies. In <em>Managing Cloud Services with
ConPaaS</em>, Guillaume Pierre from UR1 lead the attendees through using the
<a href="http://conpaas.eu">ConPaaS</a> web service interface to deploy a WordPress blog.
In <em>Dataflow Programming with Maxeler</em>, Peter Sanders from Maxeler discussed
how FPGA data flow engines achieve computational speedup over conventional CPUs
despite their lower Mhz ratings by allowing users to create deep processing
pipelines, and showed attendees how to develop custom FPGA configurations using
the Maxeler IDE. Attendees were even given access to a virtual machine running
a DFE similar so they could follow along with the programming exercises on
their own laptops. In <em>Distributed Filesystems with XtreemFS</em>, Christoph
Kleinweber from ZIB explained the differences between networked and distributed
filesystems and showed attendees how to build a storage solution using
<a href="http://xtreemfs.org">XtreemFS</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, in <em>EGI Federated Cloud for Open Science</em> Diego Scardaci and Gergely
Sipos from EGI, a separate project with collaborative ties to HARNESS,
demonstrated how attendees could access the EGI federated cloud, a multi-site
research oriented and publicly funded cloud targeted at computational
researchers in the European Union.</p>

<p>There was also a keynote on the topic of Heterogeneous Accelerators in the
Cloud given by Professor Alexander Wolf (HARNESS, ICL), and a demonstration of
the HARNESS cloud platform given by Gabriel Coutinho (HARNESS, ICL).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with some of my Ansible roles to improve the support
for multiple-environment deployments. Previously, I&rsquo;d been using a somewhat
naive approach of simply including environment-specific task lists using
conditionals in tasks/main.yml like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">include</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">ubuntu-install.yml</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">when</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">ansible_distribution == &quot;Ubuntu&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">include</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">centos-install.yml</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">when</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">ansible_distribution == &quot;CentOS&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However there are a number of problems with this approach: 1) it requires
keeping and maintaining separate task lists for each environment, 2)
deployments to different environments are done sequentially rather than in
parallel, and 3) it pollutes the output from ansible with lots of skipped tasks
for unused environments.</p>

<p>In general, it is better to use environment-specific variables with the same
task list for different environments, this reduces the maintenance overhead,
allows for parallel deployment, and reduces the size of the output.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The authors of a recent article featured in <em>Times Higher Education</em>, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/is-academic-citizenship-under-strain/2018134.article">Is &lsquo;academic citizenship&rsquo; under strain?</a>&rdquo;, argue persuasively that changes in policy and the funding environment are
pushing academics to focus more and more on the primary tasks of teaching and
research, at the expense of a large class of less widely known activities that
are nonetheless essential to the academic enterprise. The points they make will
resonate with any academic who has tried to find the time to make significant
real-world contributions in today&rsquo;s metric-focused environment. However,
despite its aspirations, the article is not truly comprehensive: One critical
area of activity neglected in the piece is that of developing and maintaining
the software and infrastructures that enable modern computing-based research.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been working with <a href="http://ansible.com">Ansible</a> quite a lot for the past
year, but until this weekend I really hadn&rsquo;t had much of a chance to get
acquainted with <a href="http://docker.io">Docker</a>. There&rsquo;s a lot of talk on the
Internet about how these two different pieces of technology &ldquo;naturally&rdquo;
compliment each other, but clearly there&rsquo;s also a lot of confusion as well, and
there are still a few hard interface problems that need to be sorted out.</p>

<p>When I first hear that Ansible could be used to both provision and deploy
Docker containers, I naturally assumed that this meant I&rsquo;d be able to adapt my
existing Ansible workflow, possibly with the addition of some new modules to
use, and have access to the power of Docker, but this hasn&rsquo;t proven to be the
case <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, the two functionalities, deployment and provisioning, are completely
disconnected from each other. To build images and deploy containers there are
two new modules: docker_image and docker, that work pretty much like you&rsquo;d
expect. It should be noted that the docker_image module can really only be used
to build images using existing Dockerfiles, and in fact there is little that it
can to do actually affect the internal workings of the image. To provision,
that is configure, an image, an entirely different approach is required: the
playbook or role needs to be copied into the container filesystem and then run
as a deployment to localhost. The problem with this, of course, is that this
makes it very difficult to coordinate configuration and state information. This
probably has a lot to do with the approach to containerized deployment
emphasized by Docker, wherein images are relatively static, and configuration
is done at deploy time by running scripts in linked containers. This may even be
the best way to do things, but it does make it difficult to adapt existing
playbooks and roles to work with docker.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today at the <a href="http://www.harness-project.eu">HARNESS project</a> integration team
meeting I gave a brief
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/marklee1977/devops-39666655">presentation</a> wherein I
discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> and some of my favorite
tools, namely <a href="http://ansible.com">Ansible</a>, <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>,
and <a href="http://docker.io">Docker</a>.</p>

<p>The central thesis of my talk was that a modern devops approach, based in
version-controlled configuration management implemented using industry-standard
deployment tools and making use of continuous integration and rolling updates
is a must for creating robust distributed systems with lots of moving parts.
Interactive configuration of cloud systems and virtual machines leads to
unreproducible, poorly documented, error-prone &ldquo;brittle&rdquo; systems. It is the
equivalent of collaborative authoring of documents by emailing word processor
files, or software version control by having a backup/ directory containing
numbered/dated zip archives. This leads to a &ldquo;culture of fear&rdquo; wherein people
are afraid to try to fix known problems for fear of &ldquo;making things worse&rdquo;, and
every roll out of of a new api or set of features becomes a dreaded nightmare.</p>

<p>Overall, the talk was well received. We also discussed the Vagrant workflow, and
how, while Docker can be used to provision containers that function the same
way as &ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; virtual machines, ideally each container should really
only be running the minimum number of processes, following the single
responsibility principle.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a great time yesterday at the
<a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/workshop-research-software-engineers">Workshop for Research Software Engineers</a>
put on by the
<a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">Sustainable Software Institute</a> and
hosted at the <a href="http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford e-Research Centre</a>.
While there, I had an interesting conversation with
<a href="http://ipg.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/">Ian Gent</a>, writer of
&ldquo;<a href="http://recomputation.org/">The Recomputation Manifesto</a>&rdquo;. You
should head over to the site and read some of Ian&rsquo;s articles, particularly
<a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-07-09-recomputation-manifesto">this one</a>,
as he&rsquo;s put quite a lot of thought into the topic. The gist of the
idea is as follows (apologies Ian for any misunderstandings, you should really
go to his site after this one): 1) computational experiments are only valuable
if they can be verified and validated, 2) in theory, it should be fairly easy
to make computational science experiments, particularly small-scale computer
science experiments, perfectly repeatable for all time, 3) in practice this is
never/rarely done and reproduction/verification is really hard, 4) the best or
possibly only way to accomplish this goal is to make sure that the entire
environment is reproducible by packaging it in a virtual machine.</p>

<p>I have a few thoughts of my own on how we can better accomplish these goals
after the break. The implementation of these ideas should be fairly simple and
basically add up to extending or developing a few system utilities and
systematically archiving distributions and updates on a service like
<a href="http://figshare.com">figshare</a>, but I believe that the benefits to
the cause of improving the reproducibility of computational experiments would be
enormous.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of us are familiar with the classical narrative of ongoing scientific
progress: that each new discovery builds upon previous ones, creating an ever
upward-rising edifice of human knowledge shaped something like an inverted
pyramid. There&rsquo;s also an idea that, in the semi-distant past of a few hundred
years ago one person could know all the scientific knowledge of his (or her)
time, but today the vast and ever-expanding amount of information available
means that scientists must be much more specialized, and that as time passes
they will become ever more specialized.</p>

<p>There is some truth to these ideas, but there are problems as well: when new
knowledge is created, how is it added to the edifice? How do we make sure that
future scholars will know about it and properly reference it in their own works?
If a scientist must be incredibly specialized to advance knowledge, then what
does he (or she) do when just starting out? How does one choose a field of
research? And what happens when the funding for research into that area dries
up? Contrary to what we learned in grade school, a scientist cannot choose to
simply study, say, some obscure species of Peruvian moth and spend the next 40
years of summers in South America learning everything there is to know about it
without also spending some time justifying that decision to colleagues and
funding bodies.</p>

<p>A lot of my research is based around developing and testing heuristic algorithms for various computation problems, in particular, I try to develop and adapt vector-packing based heuristics for scheduling virtual machines in distributed heterogeneous environments.</p>
<p>Toward this end, I&#8217;ve spent a fair amount of time investigating the large data trace released by google in 2011. The trace is available through Google Cloud Storage, and can be downloaded using the gsutil utility, which can be installed in a python virtual environment via pypi/pip. I want to be able to use this trace to generate synthetic problem instances to use to test my heuristics.</p>
<p>If you spot any mistakes or errors in my code then please leave a comment or email me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In our department there&rsquo;s a course that includes lab sections on programming
fluid dynamics simulations in <a href="http://openfoam.com" title="OpenFOAM: The open source CFD toolbox">OpenFOAM</a>, which isn&rsquo;t supported by the
University&rsquo;s IT services. We&rsquo;ve traditionally gotten around this by installing
the required environment in a virtual machine image and running it with
<a href="http://www.vmware.com" title="VMware">VMWare</a> under MS Windows, but there are infrastructural headaches associated
with this approach: the image is several gigabytes in size, and so distributing
to all of the machines and importing it into VMWare manually on a large number
of machines is time consuming and tedious. The research fellow who runs these
lab sections asked me to help him come up with a solution to this problem, so my
suggestion was to create some minimal virtual machine images that users could
download and import into VMware quickly, and have the root file system shared
out from a server over NFS. I&rsquo;ve decided to document the process of creating
these images here, on the off chance it might turn out to be useful to someone
else. The commands documented below were run on an <a href="http://ubuntu.com" title="Ubuntu Linux">Ubuntu</a> 12.10 system.</p>
