Mark Stillwell is a Researcher in the Distributed Software Engineering Group at
Imperial College London in the United Kingdom, working on the EU-sponsored
HARNESS project to develop methods for exploiting heterogeneous processing
elements for computational tasks in a cloud environment. The main subjects of
his research are scheduling algorithms for distributed systems and simulation
of distributed computing platforms, with a focus on high performance and
scientific computing. He is also interested in the problems of managing small
and large scale computational experiments, with the goal of enabling open and
transparent science. He obtained his B.S. from the University of Florida, USA
in 1999, M.S. degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University
of Florida, USA in 2002 and 2003 respectively, and his Ph.D. from the
University of Hawaii at Manoa, USA in 2010.
