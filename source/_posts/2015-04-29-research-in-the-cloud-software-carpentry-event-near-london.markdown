I'm very excited to announce that for the past month I have been working on the
arrangements for a cloud-oriented 
[software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) event, and we are now ready 
to start recruiting for participants! The 
[event](https://harnesscloud.github.io/2015-07-15-feltham/), which is going to 
be held at the SAP offices in Feltham (near London Heathrow) July 15-17, is 
being organized as a dissemination activity for the European FP7 
[HARNESS project](http://www.harness-project.eu). At this event we will extend 
the standard software carpentry curriculum of task automation, modular 
programming, and version control, with additional modules on cloud computing, 
including deployment, configuration, and management of virtual machines. 
End-user-ready cloud computing software projects supported by the project will 
be covered, particularly the [ConPaaS](http://www.conpaas.eu/) runtime 
environment and the [XtreemFS](http://www.xtreemfs.org/) distributed filesystem. 
Participants will also learn about programming 
[Dataflow](https://www.maxeler.com/technology/dataflow-computing/) engines from 
Maxeler and how to access the public 
[EGI Federated Cloud](http://www.egi.eu/infrastructure/cloud/) infrastructure 
for research. There will be a keynote on the HARNESS project and how it is 
helping to bring the power of heterogeneous accelerators to the cloud. 

In addition to the project partners, there will be representatives from
[EGI](http://egi.eu) and the 
[Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)](http://www.softare.ac.uk) present to 
teach some of the modules and provide additional support.

Participation is free, but only 40 places are available, so sign up now!

Details, including a link to the Eventbrite signup page, are available at the
event website: https://harnesscloud.github.io/2015-07-15-feltham/
