The authors of a recent article featured in *Times Higher Education*, "[Is 'academic citizenship' under strain?](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/is-academic-citizenship-under-strain/2018134.article)", argue persuasively that changes in policy and the funding environment are
pushing academics to focus more and more on the primary tasks of teaching and
research, at the expense of a large class of less widely known activities that
are nonetheless essential to the academic enterprise. The points they make will
resonate with any academic who has tried to find the time to make significant
real-world contributions in today's metric-focused environment. However,
despite its aspirations, the article is not truly comprehensive: One critical
area of activity neglected in the piece is that of developing and maintaining
the software and infrastructures that enable modern computing-based research.
